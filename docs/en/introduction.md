# Introduction
VK-IO - This is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the VK API thanks to a its simplified interface and its flexibility by providing a level of abstraction over the standard API.

## What for?
- Almost 100% API coverage
- 100% based on Promise

- Multifunctional

## Prehistory
In the beginning, I needed a simple and convenient library for working with APIs, but every time I tried a new library, it was often inconvenient or simply not updated for a couple of years. And so it came to light `vk-io` which took into account all these inconveniences and corrected them on the vine.
